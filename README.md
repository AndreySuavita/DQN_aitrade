# Trading Bot with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a trading bot using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, specifically focusing on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and LSTM-based approaches for cryptocurrency trading on the Binance platform.

## Project Overview

The project combines traditional trading strategies with advanced machine learning techniques to create an automated trading system. It includes implementations of:
- Double DQN (DDQN) for hourly trading
- Integration with Binance API for real-time trading

## Features

- Real-time cryptocurrency data fetching from Binance
- Automated trading execution with market orders
- Balance tracking and management
- Multiple RL model implementations
- Support for both testnet and mainnet trading
- Advanced risk management and position sizing
- Real-time performance monitoring and analytics
- Customizable trading strategies and parameters

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Binance account (for API access)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for training)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreySuavita/DQN_aitrade.git
cd Bot_RL_v1
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
